# FanControl.Liquidctl.Continue

This is a fork of [jmarucha](https://github.com/jmarucha/FanControl.Liquidctl)'s original.
1. It stops **liquidctl** from starting and stopping all the time by attempting to retry on return any error.
2. Updated the **liquidctl** library to support **ASUS ROG pump embedded fan**.
3. Fixed **Degree Symbol (Â°)** UTF-8 error for some PC with **Windows Language for non-Unicode programs** changed.

This is a simple plugin that uses [liquidctl](https://github.com/liquidctl/liquidctl) to provide sensor data and pump control to variety of AIOs. So far it is tested with NZXT Kraken X63, but in principle shall work with [supported devices](https://github.com/liquidctl/liquidctl#supported-devices)

## Installation

1. Download **FanControl.Liquidctl.zip** from [Release](https://github.com/chaixshot/FanControl.Liquidctl.Continue/releases/latest)
2. Open **Fan Control** **>** Setting **>** Plugin **>** Install plugin... **>** Select **FanControl.Liquidctl.zip** > Open

## Setting up the developer environment

The project, after being imported to Visual Studio needs to have it reference to `FanControl.Plugins.dll` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` from FanControl directory. You also need to create the executable of liquidctl, which can be automatized with script `build-liquidctl.sh`.
